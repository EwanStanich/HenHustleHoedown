For running/downloading the game at https://e1andonly.itch.io/hen-hustle-hoedown:


Mac:
When running the game in browser, limitation in the Godot game engine cause levels 3 and 8 to load much slower. The browser will freeze temporarily but after 10-20 seconds the level should load and the browser go back to normal.
As I do not have a verified developer certificate, opening the game from the download will cause the macOS Gatekeeper to deny access. To bypass this, search Gatekeeper in settings and there will be a prompt to open the game.
