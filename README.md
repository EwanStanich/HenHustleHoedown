For running/downloading the game at https://e1andonly.itch.io/hen-hustle-hoedown:

Windows:
**Run in the browser** - as this game was made using the macOS version of Godot, issues have arisen when porting to Windows, I do not have the expertise to fix these issues at this time, so the game can only be run in the browser.

Mac:
**Do not run in browser** - unknown to me when I started this project, Godot 4 has an issue with its html5 port that makes it incompatible with macOS devices, causing long load times that freeze the browser for upwards of a minute. Due to this, the Mac download is available. As I do not have a verified developer certificate, opening the game from download will cause the macOS Gatekeeper to deny access. To bypass this, search Gatekeeper in settings and there will be a prompt to open the game.
